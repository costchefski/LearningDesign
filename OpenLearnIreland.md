## 0. Introduction

This is a planning document for a learning design process of an OpenLearn Ireland interactive

## 1. OpenLearn KPIs:

- Increase traffic to page by promoting a new way of interacting with existing content
- Increase time spent on site by ensuring that users navigate to links which they find meaningful
- Increase click-through to course prospectus pages by including relevant links in each category

## 2. User objectives:

- "I want to explore OpenLearn Ireland content in a more visual way."
- "I'm up for a little game of exploration."
- "I want to learn about the island of Ireland, its history, and its modern times."

## 3. Rules:

- Users are free to explore all of the island, and all resources
- Users unlock digital objects after clicking on certain content
- There are no ways of "getting it wrong" here
- The interactive serves a purpose when a user a) clicks on an OpenLearn piece or b) clicks on a Course prospectus page

## 4. Gameplay loop:

### Begin
- Arrive at welcome screen
- Interact to launch map
- Move on to explore map

### Explore the interactive
- Choose an area
- Choose a "pin"
- Explore information about the pin
- Interact to launch content
- Move to a different area and repeat

### Leave the interactive
- Tab over to the OpenLearn content and start interacting with page

## 5. Goals for learners
- Ultimate: arrive at an OpenLearn / Open University page of their choice
- Intermediate: keep exploring the interactive (and unlocking items)
- Immediate: explore the next link on the map

## 6. Motivation
- (possibly) track the percentage of the island they visited
- unlocked objects: connected to the island of Ireland and to our content, to keep learners on page
- (very possibly) a quiz at the end?

## 7. Tools
Elucidat - could start with this one https://www.elucidat.com/showcase/#on-the-job-sales-support
H5P - https://h5p.org/image-hotspots#example=63175
HTML5 area map - https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_areamap - this might be a start of the accessible version?
